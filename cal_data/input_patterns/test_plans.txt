File name format is:
    so<mapping>_se<mapping>_<other stuff>.dat

Mapping is the mapping from fixture axes to source/sensor (mover)
axes.  Term "mover" is clearer, because these are the axes of the
moving part of the fixture, and are not always the same as the axes of
the attached source or sensor.

This is the representation for the axis mapping:
 -- "out" is a synonym for fixture +Y.  Now the source fixture uses the same
    Rz orientation as the stage (and sensor fixture), so "out" is in the same
    direction for both.
 -- "up" is a synonym for fixture +Z.
 -- We represent the axis mapping by which mover axis is "out" and
    "up".  If the out/up axis is negative, then we use in/down.
 -- out/in always comes before up/down.  So YoutZup, YinZup, etc.

So ZoutYup means:
	Mover		Fixture
____________________________________
	+Z (Z)		+Y (out)
	+Y (Y)		+Z (up)
	+X		-X	(implied by right hand convention)

Only certain fixturings are supported by our fixtures:

Sensor:
	old name	new name
________________________________________________________________
	Z_rot		YoutZup		The home fixture
	X_rot		ZinYup		Rotated +90 degrees about stage X
	Y_rot		ZinXup		Additionally rotated +90 about stage Y

Source:
	new name
________________________________________________________________
	YoutZup		The home fixture
	XoutZup		Rotate +90 about Z
	ZoutYup		Flip sides so Z out
	XinYup		Flip and +90 about Z
