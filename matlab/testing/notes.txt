Axis offsets:
-2.72	1.552	-3.8	0	0	1.4

Stage alignment check.

Alignment of fixture vertical with stage Z, proxy for normality between
fixture and Rz axis (which we are assuming is parallel to the Z translation
axis).  (Stage Rz @ 90 degrees)

Rx via 25mm Z move, indicated on back of post top mount:
    3 um

Ry via 30mm Z move, indicated on side of fixture post
    125 um


Rz alignment runout, taken at +90 Rz, -90 Rz and 0
	90:  0
	0:   0.031
	-90: 0.060

So basically it is off 30 um in both X and Y.  This is a measure of how
accurately the Rz axis intersects Rx Ry (with some assumption about the
accuracy of the fixtures).  Any non-intersection creates a
rotation->translation moment of the mismatch magnitude.

These alignments all seem fairly reasonable.  The only one that kind of rises
to the level of adjustment is the Ry alignment (pole sideways tip).  But this
has been very soft in the past, difficult to get it to stay below 100 um.
Now, these alignments could certainly contribute 100's of um error across the
workspace, which is a problem for evaluating the desired performance, but
can't explain the 

The Rz runout is going to cause an error of basically that runout. Simple
angular misalignment of the fixture wrt. the stage translation axes is not a
source of error, since the can be absorbed into the fixture transform.  But
non-normality of Rz with Rz Ry is also an error source.  This creates a
magnified error at the edge of the workspace because the points generated by
Rz rotation lie in a different plane that the fixture XY plane.  I guess this
is magnified by the moment ratio of the motion offset vs. the runout
measurment distance.  So over +/-50 mm we would expect about +/- 200 um
above/below the XY plane.

The same magnification would apply to any Rx Ry non-orthogonality (which so
far I have assumed is negligible).
