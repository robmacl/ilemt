 -- Magnetic interference from stage setup


Maybe later:
 -- Other more ad-hoc calibration parameters?
     - Could do eg. multilinear interpolation, but this is not going to work
       at all outside of the calibrated workspace.
     - LUT interpolation might generalize better if it was done in a more
       physically relevant coordinates, eg. coupling/magnetic


Paper ideas:

Current aim is the cross-coupling paper.  For that we need some extra
experiments and simulations to get at the mechanism and magnitude.  Literature
search.  three-axis magnetometer calibration

[cross-coupling]
  Source-source and sensor-sensor coil coupling can be big problems
   - Depends on concentric vs. non, sensor loading, whether source coils are
     driven simultaneously.
   - Ferrite core problematic with non-concentric coils
   - Source coupling is a big issue with FDM, and probably not with TDM,
     depending on driver details.
   - Can use current sense to reduce source coil coupling
   - Can also minimize coupling through concentric coils or non-concentric
     arrangements. 
   - Need to establish these claims somehow.  Simply using calibration accuracy
     experiments is not very good because there is not a simple causal
     relation.  Given eg. field map or simulations, can be presented as more
     general than ILEMT, and not needing a lot of ILEMT context.
   - 2D FEMM XY simulation?  Not accurate, but a good visualization
   - There are enough points that it can't be a short paper

[calibration]
  ILEMT calibration accuracy report:
   - We have this thing which has some kind of accuracy
   - Background on project
   - Calibration and test methods
   - Sensitivity of the pose solution to coupling error?  Possible short paper
     in itself.
   - Not an omnibus all-the-results paper, without: dynamic and noise
     performance, metal rejection, in-vivo accuracy compared to ASAP, EMI
     tolerance, etc.
   - If you don't think about those omissions, then this can resemble the
     journal standard of being the final results on a project.  It is (we
     hope) a wrap-up within the limited scope of static accuracy w/o
     interference. 
   - Need to resolve cross-coupling issues first, and get the best accuracy we
     can easily get.  Try the concentric source/sensor
   - No emphasis on the dipole-approximating coil (especially if it isn't used
     for our headline results).

[quadrupole]
  Dipole/quadrupole story (tentative because of coil interactions, and weird
  quadrupole fit):
   - Dipole-approx coil fairly accurate
   - Dipole performance may be limited by cross-coupling.  Use the best
     dipole-approximating source arrangement, reference [cross-coupling].
   - Quadrupole can help a bit
   - This is a plausible tidy result, possible short paper.
   - Show model deviation in the coupling space, not just pose accuracy.
     Sensitivity of pose solution.
   - Discussing pose accuracy needs the ILEMT context. Needs to reference
     [calibration]

[system]
  Hardware description, signal processing, noise and dynamics performance.
  Accuracy update.
   - Need to mention high/low motivation, but no evaluation here

[high/low metal]

[21 May 21]


Took a look at check_poses() on:
    cal_data\cal_5_19_dipole_cmu\Z_rot_ld_source_move.dat

where there is a big motion and rotation of the source.  Results are
disappointing, but not appalling.

First, there is a problem with the pose solution convergence.  Even after
adjusting for the negative X present by constraining to the +Y hemisphere,
there are 106 points that failed to converge.  A better initial state might
help, or trying several initial states.  The previous pose convergence
problems went away when I improved the sensor cross coupling.  So having a
poor fitting model definitely aggravates the situation.  Possibly this is
contributed to by not having derivatives in the optimization.

I tried running a Z-only calibration to find the source fixture, and that did
not work.  It seems that calibration can't deal with the source fixture being
way wrong.

So, error is increased a bit more than 2x.

The pose solution completely failed when I tried the corresponding quadrupole
calibration: 
    cal_5_13_dipole_cmu/so_quadrupole_all_hr_cal.mat

This is consistent with my thinking that the source quadrupole calibration is
being hugely warped by not seeeing the source from enough different
directions.

My feel is that results would be much improved if we had multiple source
fixturings in the calibration, and I have been developing a concept for that.
The Rx rotator we built for the source is just not going to be accurate enough
unless we locate and interface an encoder with much higher resolution.  And we
also just don't need continuous rotation.

Before we can publish calibration results we need:
 1] A reliable pose solution
 2] Measurement that is robust across a much wider pose space.

So the source fixturing is a pretty high priority.  Fixing the calibration may
fix the solution, but also we can do something like initialize the pose using
the closed-form solution (even though it isn't fully general for our
calibration model).


I got the source fixtures for the dipole-source variations, with the rotated
cube, and also the in-line configuration.  Possibly a dipole-only calibration
with these would generalize better to more varied source fixtures, since the
dipole conformance is already much better than the concentric cube, and may be
further improved when cross-coupling effects are reduced.

It's discourging for replication that we are needing so much calibration data
with our specialized stage setup.  But it is still plausible that once we have
a calibration that it will work fairly well across duplicate coils, especially
with the non-concentric dipole, where manufacturing is less demanding.  The
dipole-only calibration also does not seem to need a whole lot of data, and
even for quadrupole or other higher order models, likely we will decide that
there are degrees of freedom we don't need (perhaps force the quadrupole to
the same position as the dipole).

So there are two somewhat divergent directions for calibration/accuracy work:
 1] Get real good accuracy
 2] Get a source/sensor setup that can be replicated

Either way, we first need to get accuracy which is not embarrassing.  Using
the Premo source (and sensor) is an easy path to [2].  There is some value in
using diverse sources and sensors, in that it shows the flexibility of ILEMT
(and really of magnetic trackers in general).

I would say max error < 1mm and RMS error < 400 um is "not embarrassing",
which is where we are with the single source fixture, but this needs to be
reached over a large workspace, ideally any chosen source hemisphere.  We need
this for at least one source/sensor configuration, ideally with several.


If we are going to incorporate multiple source fixturings in the calibration,
then we need another transform in the kinematic chain, and more fitted
parameters.  It may work to have the new transform fully specified, and then
to let existing parameters move, like the Z position and moment.  We could
have a nominal translation from fixture origin to source origin (just to give
a pleasing source origin), and then fold in the fixtured rotations.  Having
three axis rotations in the fixture creates a definite origin for the fixture.

So, for one, there is a terminological problem.  The way that we fixture the
source seems like it ought to be called the source fixture.

Currently we have:
    source_fixture -> stage_pose (with sensor fixturings) -> sensor_fixture

What source fixture is currently doing is absorbing the difference between the
source and stage coordinates.  This includes both the source-sensor offset and
the (delibrate and incidental) misalignment of the source with the stage.


Working on the calibration using the Premo sensor and CMU-concentric source.
Previously, did only a Z-only calibration.

The dipole-only calibration accuracy is in a similar ballpark to what we have
been getting with other source/sensor combinations.  eg. the
CMU-concentric/corner-dipole dipole-only on [14 May 21].  It's plausible that
with the concentric source the dipole-nonconformity is dominating the error.

This seems to be a nice low error (although the rotation is messed up due to
wrapping).  But the calibration is not physically credible.  YZ are not doing
much at all, and are in random positions.  X is doing something, but
both the dipole and quadrupole positions have wandered to a rather silly
degree (64mm) in -X.  This is much the lowest error we have gotten so far,
which is nice, but I don't expect it to generalize to any significantly
different source orientation.


[19 May 21]

 ==> In axis sweep, off-axis and cross DNL look screwy.  They aren't the
     derivative of the displayed INL.  The on-axis results are sensible.
 ==> Mess with the SG filter params, maybe too much smoothing?

Got a higher res axis sweep with current calibration, cal_5_19_dipole_cmu.
Looking at this, it seems the position error is quite linear, basically scale
error, with off-axis error that could be interpreted as axis misalignment.
Thinking of trying a pseudo-inverse correction.  While this is unlikely to
generalize to significantly different source orientations, would be
interesting to see what it can do.
 ==> If linear transform on pose is effective, this suggests an error taking
     place in Euclidian space, i.e. not a magnetic effect, possibly a ground
     truth error.

 ==> The errors we are seeing are not way higher than plausible stage error,
     maybe 3x to 5x?  Not 10x.  This is worrying.  eg. I said stage XY
     orthogonality is 0.6 mrad, whereas off-axis translation due to X is about
     1.2 mrad.


 ==> Thought about how reducing residue might not reduce "error".  I've been
     paying most attention to position error, so possibly a change that
     reduces orientation error at the cost of position might go unnoticed.
     But IIRC, in the screwed cases both trans and rot got worse.


Looked again, using new error_scatter() function, and in cal_5_13_dipole_cmu
there is a definite trend for position error to increase at the lower coupling
magnitudes.  Interestingly, the rotation error sort of decreases (reduces in
variance) at the lower couplings.

The effect is less pronounced when we plot vs. the sensor distance (from
nominal source origin).  Note that this is with the concentric CMU cube
source, so the source-sensor distance is fairly well-defined.  This suggests
that the larger errors may arise in situations where the coupling is
unfavorable due to relative orientation.

The rotation effect is rather more surprising, but I guess comes from better
dipole approximation.  Our calibration normalization by the coupling magnitude
might also contribute, since we weight the more distant poses higher, which in
some sense degrades the accuracy of the closer poses.


[14 May 21]

Summary:
 -- Got a pretty good calibration result with CMU-concentric cube source and
    corner-dipole sensor, using source quadrupole.  344 um RMS translation,
    1090 um max.
 -- The cube source seems to have significantly higher quadrupole, resulting
    in more benefit and less silly fit results.
 -- The sensor fixture transform and sensor dipole positions (for corner
    dipole) are quite similar between this data and
    cal_data/cal_11_5/XYZ_hr_cal, despite being taken on different days.
 -- When we are looking at error differences of 10's of percent, and
    quadrupole calibration, we need to be running comparisons with the same data
    size: medium three-fixture calibration and large three-fixture test.


Seems perhaps we are not primarily limited by source or sensor cross coupling
currently?  Because our tested accuracy is roughly similar between the various
concentric and non-concentric sources and sensors.

Something I did notice is that there seems to be less rotation-translation
coupling in the error vectors with the CMU-concentric/corner-dipole setup:
they splay out less across the rotations.  I would think that translation
error due to sensor rotation would mainly be due to sensor effects, but this
is the same sensor that we started out with, the only thing nominally
different is the source.

It also does seem that with recent data, eg. using the CMU-concentric source,
that the tendency for errors to be specifically associated with -Z and -Y is
reduced, so that error more generally increases away from the workspace center
in all directions.

There is the general pattern of U-shaped error as you move away from the
center.  While broadly, a tendency for error to get worse away from the center
is somewhat reasonable, this would be more the case as you go outside of the
calibrated region.  An insufficient model could cause this sort of thing; the
optimization is doing its best to minimize the error by splitting the
difference. 


I need to more consistently compare the different configurations, using the
same calibration and test data input types, eg. calibrate with medium, test
with large, or whatever.

Also, it is possible there is non-reproducibility in our procedure.  Worth
taking some data that is supposed to be the same, and seeing if the results
differ, and perhaps directly compare the data.


"funny things" to follow up on:
 -- Is premo sensor with CMU concentric source really much better than with
    corner-dipole source?  Then why, with corner-dipole source is it much
    worse than corner-dipole sensor with that source?  And premo /
    CMU-concentric is not better?
 -- Why does Premo sensor quadrupole calibration make error so much worse? Big
    difference between optimizing residue vs. pose error.


I'd like to look at the coupling error vs. the pose error in poses with bad
pose error.  I guess, more generally, can scatter coupling error vs. pose
error.


I'd kind of been thinking that the calibration fit was getting worse as I
added the three rotations, but the residual is not normalized by the number
calibration points, and is expected to increase linearly.  Getting a residual
of 6e-3 with three-angle medium data is entirely in line with a residual of
1e-3 for single-angle small data.  We are getting a bit lower in that case,
but not a lot lower, something like 0.85e-3.

If we take the per-point squared residual, and take the sqrt(), then the
per-point RMS residual is something like 4e-3.

This is a reasonable result; it sort of meets my goal of <400um RMS <1mm max.
We are pretty solidly below 400um RMS.  Note that testing with the large data
actually helped both RMS and max.  The RMS kind of makes sense because we add
more interior points which have lower error.  So it does not seem to hurt to
test with the large three-fixture data, which is good.  And testing with
Z-only data is also worse, I think because error seems somewhat concentrated
in that fixturing.

This is with the source quadrupole calibration, which this time has behaved
rather more sensibly with this source/sensor and cal data.  The error vectors
seem more balanced across the workspace, and the quadrupole seems more
physically plausible, with smallish position offsets and somewhat diagonal
moments.  With my cube coil it is fairly plausible that there is off-center
stuff, because it is hand wound with incomplete layers on an asymmetrical
core.  It is even plausible that the pattern varies across the axes, because
of the layering.  But my suspicion is that there are still big problems with
observability of the YZ quadrupole.

This is what we get with the dipole-only calibration:

With this configuration we are getting a fairly significant 23% reduction in
RMS translation and 19% max from the quadrupole.  It seems that the dipole
error of this source may be better approximated by a quadrupole than is the
case for the corner-dipole source.  This supported by the X quadrupole
magnitude from cal_5_11/all_hr_cal being about 5x smaller.

Comparing the quadrupole to dipole-only calibration, what is different?  The
dipole source positions have moved quite a bit off-center.  And the dipole
moment decreased.  Also, the sensor gain has increased about 2% (surely
actually a source referred effect).

The d_sensor_pos and sensor fixture really have not changed.  The source
fixture X has moved 5mm, but this is probably related to the mm motions of the
dipole positions.  Because we are forcing the Z dipole to zero position, if
the Z dipole has moved (eg. due to the Z quadrupole) then it will drag the
source fixture pose.  Likewise, when the Z quadrupole adds to the Z dipole
(unit moment) then this changes the gain, and so the d_sensor_moment.  It's
not great that the origin is moving off the presumed mechanical center of the
source, but if we really care about that, then we should mechanically center
the calibration, such as by adding source rotations.

Note that the quadrupole that we got from optimizing only the source
quadrupole (position and moment) and the source dipole (moment only) really do
not agree very well at all with what we ended up with after the full
optimization.  I'll add the source dipole positions to the initial quadrupole
optimization.

FWIW, comparing this calibration to cal_data/cal_5_11/XYZ_hr_cal, the sensor
dipole positions and sensor fixture are very similar, within 10's of um and a
mrad or so.  This is encouraging about the repeatability of the sensor
fixturing.  (The sensor moment magnitude is quite different because the CMU
concentric source seems about 2x stronger, but the off-axis is kind of
similar, though one sign flip.)


[13 May 21]

Summary:
 -- CMU concentric cube coil is working fairly well.
 -- Cube source axis orthogonality is much better (20x) than the corner-dipole
    source.
 -- Failure of coupling bias estimation strongly suggests other error sources
    are dominant (though reducing cal residue has not always improved pose
    error).
 -- If current error is due to magnetic interference, then the real issue is
    what would happen in a more realistic environment.  But we are probably
    not seeing much magnetic interference, based on the radial motion due to
    interferers.
 -- Trying sensor quadrupole with small three fixture data on Premo sensor did
    not end well, which is not surprising.  But odd how terrible the error was
    when tested on the same data as used for cal.  Minimizing coupling residue
    clearly does not always minimize pose error.
 -- A bit of testing of the sensitivity of pose solution to coupling
    perturbations.  It seems to be in the ballpark of delta*r, though
    usually 2-3x better.  Ideas for systematic sensitivity test.
 

The CMU concentric coil seems to work pretty well, based on Rz only
calibration and testing.

With cal_5_12_premo_cmu, the CMU coil and Premo sensor, I get:

This is a better than the best corner-dipole/dipole results, especially on max
error, and RMS is quite significantly better that corner-dipole/premo.  For
some reason the check_poses fixture optimization flaked out, perhaps related
to the sensor fixture rotation being near pi?

Source axis orthogonality is ~20x better than the corner-dipole source, which
is probably related to less cross-coupling.  As I think I noted before, the
off-axis compensation converges much faster with the CMU-concentric source
than with the corner-dipole.  The concentricity according to the d_source_pos
(~2mm) is also pretty good, considering the core is made from glued E-cores
(with holes) rather than an actual cube, and is also hand-wound.

The Y source moment being flipped seems to be a Premo sensor interaction,
because it doesn't happen with the CMU-concentric/corner-dipole.


What to do next?
 -- it seems likely that the combo of CMU-concentric source with the dipole
    sensor will give the best accuracy yet.  So we want a good amount of data
    in that setup. 
 -- worth trying whether the sensor quadrupole helps the Premo sensor, and how
    much the source quadrupole helps the CMU-concentric.  To look at
    quadrupole, we want the XYZ data, preferably medium size. 
 -- Revisit coupling bias correction, look at pose sensitivity to coupling.


What are we trying to achieve here?
 -- Low error, over full pose space (not currently tested)
 -- Insight into error mechanisms.  What is the effectiveness of the dipole
    coil?  When is cross-coupling a problem?
 -- A practical near-term source/sensor configuration
 -- Everything else: a usable real-time system, publications and documentation

Considering "everything else", one of our criteria is when to stop trying to
improve accuracy.  But it does make sense to concentrate on one thing at a
time.

Research needs feed back into experiments, but at least initially I can
concentrate on getting the best accuracy.  For maybe 2 weeks?  One research
test that could feed back into accuracy work is the coupling sensitivity.


General comments on calibration/test data:
 -- At least for dipole calibration, there is not a whole lot of difference in
    accuracy with medium vs. small data, and with three fixtures vs. one.
 -- Error is worse with three fixtures (which makes sense), and IIRC
    calibrating with three fixtures helps the three fixture test results
    (which also makes sense).
 ==> [13 May 21] Not clear this is true, cal residual is larger because more points.
 -- Three fixture medium data does seem to make the source quadrupole term
    more observable.


It tentatively seems that the quadrupole is more beneficial for the cube
coils, at least so far as calibration residual goes. (Which is what we would
expect.)  But the results are still physically unreasonable for axis asymmetry
and quadrupole location, and this is likely due to under-constraint /
insufficient data.  Might be worth a try to constrain the quadrupole to the
same location as the dipole.  This would regularize the solution into a form
that is more likely to generalize to other source configurations.  A distant
location for the quadrupole could also suggest magnetic interference.


Other interpretation:
 -- That the bias estimate from mean residue did not help kind of proves that
    other errors are dominant, probably way dominant.  Because it *would* have
    worked if bias had been dominant.
 -- If the level of magnetic interference we are seeing in the test setup is a
    problem, then it's rather hopeless to get better accuracy in any realistic
    setting.  My feel from the 1DOF measurement is that even if we multiply
    10x to get 3DOF position error, we are not going to break 200um, and 100um
    or less seems likely.


I tried sensor quadrupole with the corner-dipole/premo, and it reduced the
residue a fair amount, but made error about 2x worse, tested on the exact same
calibration data.

________________________________________________________________

It bears some thought how we can be reducing the residue yet increasing the
position error when run on the training data.  Of course if we were
overfitting then we *would* expect this, but only when run on *other* data.

So it seems that to a *significant* degree, under some conditions, minimizing
the residue is not resulting in reduced pose error.  That is, the goal we are
giving optimization is not really correct.  We've considered this general
possibility, and this is the reason for the normalization in the objective
function, but...

The thing is, the pose solution is minimizing the exact same residue, but on
only a single point.  So when we optimize the calibration ensemble, we must
not be correctly weighting the points.
 ==> One idea is that we could emperically weight the data, based on observed
     errors.  This could capture e.g. error increase at the edges of the
     workspace.
 ==> Normalizing by the norm of the coupling is not aggressive enough to
     minimize error across range variation, since (I assume, like noise) error
     goes as r^4, while field strength as 1/r^3.

 ==> Given a certain level of model error, it's a somewhat arbitrary decision
     which points to give high error, and which low.  Traditionally you try to
     equalize, which tends to minimize max error, while also working OK on
     RMS.  But given the intrinsic tendency of error to increase with range,
     perhaps it makes more sense to just allow that?

What sort of error specification you consider acceptable comes in here.
Trying to force the error to act unnaturally may increase the risk of
overfitting to the particular test data.  But this only actually applies if we
were weighting the pose error, which we are not.


Thoughts on sensitivity:

Some exploratory probes suggest that the sensitivity is about what you would
expect, or perhaps 2-3x less.  eg. a 1% scaling causes less than 1% distance
error.  In the home pose (r = 250mm), 1% scaling or 10 mrad rotation cause
about 1mm error.  For the radial translation error, we expect below linear,
since the radial distance is a cube root.  1.01^(1/3) = 1.0033

A rotation of the coupling roughly corresponds to a rotation of the measured
field, such as is caused by magnetic interference or model error.  For a
concentric symmetric sensor this is a pretty close correspondence.


To look at this systematically:
 -- Test across the workspace
 -- Try several different perturbations, eg. scaling or rotation of row or
    column of coupling
 -- Look at radial and tangential position, angular, and moment.  Summary
    statistics across these.


A somewhat different thing to consider is sensitivity to perturbations in the
calibration.

And another question is: what is the sensitivity to fixture pose error?  I
guess rotation of the sensor is similar to rotation of the coupling matrix, so
sensitivity should be similar.  And if there is stage runout, then that
directly contributes to translation error.

Summary:
 -- Concerns about fixturing accuracy and Rz runout
 -- Dipole and quadrupole calibrations with the dipole-approximating source
    and sensor.  Quadrupole helps a bit.
 -- Thoughts on how to check for input sign flips or wrong coupling signs.
 -- Premo sensor is now working ok, but error is rather worse than with the
    corner dipole sensor (Z-only test data).

I reworked forward_kinematics.m, without changing what it computes.  It is
clearer now, and also significantly faster.  I am now pretty sure it is doing
what I think it should be doing.  I have not gone over fk_coupling, the dipole
part, but that has gotten a lot of attention in the past, and seems to be
working (based on the fairly good dipole model fit).


Got new data for the dipole and premo sensors.  I re-zeroed the Rz XY offset
on the stage before taking the dipole data.  It was not too far out, something
like 100 um.  But this is not very stable, and the instability is probably
partly in alignment of the calibration fixture.  I am not at all confident in
the fixturing at the 100um level.

The premo data is not cooperating, must be inconsistent kinematics or initial
state is too far off.  But coupling at zero pose looks weird, big Y value is
not on the diagonal.


The dipole data is "medium" size, and is working, without the X sign flip (now
cancelled in ilemt_ui).

Using the medium data for calibration does not seem to have improved the
performance on the Rz only test data.  It is somewhat worse, though that may
be meaningless.  And no sign that my fiddling with accurate fixturing made a
difference either (which likely means other errors dominate).  The increase in
calibration residual is expected because there is about 2x more data.

So, with source quadrupole, with medium data, we are seeing about the same as
with the small data, but somewhat worse RMS error.  BTW, having the
'quadrupole' mode optimize 'd_so_mo', but not 'd_so_pos', or any sensor
parameters, worked quite well for getting started.  I had to add a hack to
calibrate_main to initialize the source quadrupole to non-zero due to the
zero/near-zero feature in forward_kinematics now actually working.

The XY quadrupole parameters are somewhat similar to what we got on [4 May 21]
using cal_5_3 small data, but Z is completely different.  XY also hold to the
pattern that moment is roughly diagonal, opposite in sign to the dipole, and
somewhat nearish to the dipole location.  I can't see any explanation for why
the axes would be so dissimilar except for the very asymmetric test data.
Only on X do we see both sides of the axis, and so are able to see whether the
field is axisymmetric or not.  Probably the dropping moments across YZ are due
to less support from the data.  In this run, there is really nothing from the
Z quadrupole.  Not only is the moment small, the position has run away to a
silly degree.


Is there a testing procedure for identifying the coupling signs and sensor
sign flips?  It's hard to get this right, especially when there is any
possible confusion about the sensor fixture.

 -- First, make sure the axis assignment is right, which (if the source axis
    assigment is right) we can do by checking for the strong couplings on the
    diagonal.

We need to drive the strong coupling off the diagonal to disambiguate

If flips and signs are correct, then:
 -- If you align each sensor axis the same way wrt. a single source axis, then
    the signs will all be the same, eg. + for aligned out the source axis.
 -- If you repeat this on the other source axes, then the signs will all be +
    also. 


I got the Premo sensor working, though there is a sign flip on the Z moment.

Error is somewhat worse RMS than what we are getting with the dipole sensor, but
the sensor calibration is extremely "pretty": good symmetry, orthogonality and
alignment.
 ==> This suggests that source error may dominate. Possibly worse dipole
     conformance is having an effect, need to try quadrupole.  *sensor*
     quadrupole? 

But that it does work is basically good news because it means we can get
reasonable results with a commerical sensor.

Summary:
 -- Phase calibration and sign issues in Labview


Seems we need more generality than is in the current ilemt_ui phase
calibration, to deal with different sensor fixtures, perhaps input sign
flips or even XYZ permutations.

How did we get where we are?  We needed a coupling matrix with the correct
signs.  This requires us to know what phase to expect.  The phase varies
strongly by carrier frequency, due to non-flat frequency response in both
source and input side, and also digital latency on both ends.  But the net
effect is a phase which can be attributed to the source axis (and its
associated carrier frequency).

While we can attribute all of the phase variation to the source axis, the
sensor does actually contribute (via inductance variation), so the phase
calibration is dependent at least on the sensor type.  [If there is
significant mismatch between the sensor coils, then the frequency response
would change also, though perhaps not enough to cause significant sign errors.
To be really thorough, we would need to test the sign of each 3x3 coupling.]

This requires a phase calibration, which has to take place in a pose where we
know the sign of the strong couplings.  Simplest to make this be a particular
"standard" pose, so the signs are fixed.  So far, we assume that:
 1] Phase is measured from couplings on the diagonal (which should be strong),
 2] The couplings have particular signs: +--.

The +-- signs correspond to source and sensor axes aligned, but the sensor
translated out the X axis.  Once the phase has been calibrated it should be
valid in any sensor pose, and should also be quite stable over time, at least
to the accuracy necessary for sign determination.

Where do we want to get to?  The phase calibration should be part of the
complete system calibration (as should the output frequency response).
Currently these exist only in Labview, but the signal processing is going to
move out of labview into C++.  If these calibrations are done in labview, then
the data needs to be exported out of labview.  Currently they come out of
labview through their affect on the saved coupling data.

Because of the phase correction, it doesn't matter if there are sign flips on
the output side.  But sign flips in the input *do* cause problems because it
violates the assumption (in phase correction) that the input channels are
interchangeable.

Suppose we want to be able to work around flipped input signs (which have been
a problem).  The obvious fix is to invert the input signal, and this would
work.  But the inversion only matters insofar as it affects the sign
determination, so this could also be done during phase correction.

Summary:
 -- Premo coil data has tangled signs
 -- Coupling bias as measured by shorted input is way less than what we were
    estimating during calibration optimization.
 -- CAT6 cable sheild does not seem to cause metal interference


I took data with the Premo coil, and also got the midsize data with the dipole
coil.

The Premo data seems kind of tangled up wrt signs, fixture orientations, and
the interaction with the Labview phase correction.  At a minimum, the sensor
fixture has a Rz rotation so that X and Y interchange (by observation), and also almost
certainly has Z upside-down (because the package is mounted upside down).
Moving to pose:
    [22, 0, 0, 0, 0, 90]

gives a roughly diagonal coupling matrix with sensible magnitudes, but phase
calibration is probably not forcing the correct signs, since it forces the +--
signs that we get from our previous standard orientation (source and sensor
axes aligned, sensor is placed out along the X axis).

Then there is also the mysterious X input sign flip we were seeing with the
dipole coils, which is unexplained.

I tried getting calibration to figure out sensor fixture and moment
parameters, but it wasn't really working.

Looking at the Premo data in the above pose, relative to the reference levels
for the dipole sensor, all the signs are flipped.  IIRC this is not possible
for a rotation, so some other sign has flipped, perhaps the X has come
unflipped. Say, we rotate 180 degrees about X, then flip the X sign.  And if X
is non-flipped, then we need a positive X source moment again, so not
surprising that calibration was having trouble.

Looked at the actual sensor coil, and the axis directions are as you would
expect based on the label text orientation.  And also, in the fixturing I
chose, the fixture transform is an 180 degree rotation about X.  So that makes
sense together with X getting unflipped.  But reference phase correction is
not going to work without modification.  If we rotate to the +90 Rz then the
strong couplings are on the diagonal, as expected by phase_correct_coupling,
but the signs should then be +++.

Perhaps it would be prettier to rotate the sensor post +90 degrees Rz so that
at least the X for source and sensor are aligned in the stage home position.
But the sensor fixture has to be different from with the dipole sensor because
Z is down.



I collected a bias data point 'bias.dat' with shorted input.  The magnitudes
are much lower than what we were estimating, magnitude for elements is around
2e-6, with norm of the matrix 8e-6.  This is of course just a restatement of
my earlier observation using ilemt_ui that the input shorted reading is around
-100 to -120 dB.  This is small, but is probably a noticeable source of error
at longer ranges where the coupling can be down at 1e-3 or so.


 ==> There is not any detectable effect on the measurement from putting the
     CAT6 cable foil shield near the sensor.
 ==> Calibration not working on the cal_5_7/ dipole sensor data.  Something is
     weird. Oops, I logged the current sense data.  Probably that shouldn't
     happen. 


I think it may not really make sense to publish the dipole/quadrupole results
alone, even once updated, because of new understanding about the big effects
of coil interactions.  We could have published those results, but knowing what
we now know, that is a big omission.  In order to correctly make the argument
that the quadrupole effect measures the accuracy of the dipole approximation,
we need to eliminate any bigger errors.

I've been thinking about a paper on coil interactions and concentic
vs. non-concentric, effects of sensor load and source impedance, etc.  We
could roll this into one paper with dipole effects, or perhaps publish this
first.  


[7 May 21]

I implemented the coupling bias estimation scheme I described.  It
slightly reduces the calibration residual (which it would almost have
to), but somewhat hurts the RMS accuracy.  I'm not sure that it is
reasonable to estimate bias in this way, since the non-bias part of
the residual could have a non-zero mean.  The direct way to get the
bias would be by measuring with the shorted input.

Summary:
 -- Thoughts on minimizing possible fixture error.  Fixture error can be
    thought of as inaccurate stage kinematics.
 -- Mutual inductance measured with inductance bridge on the CMU cube source
    and the biggest Premo source are all quite low, < 1e-3.


I got one of the Premo sensors wired up, and getting the fixture post
fabricated.

I need a better understanding of the kinematics of error in the RxRy fixture.

The point of the mechanical alignment procedures is to try to make sure that
the stage kinematics is correct.  So Rz needs to intersect RxRy, etc.  The
sensor fixture pose then allows for the sensor to have an arbitrary pose wrt. the
stage.

But mechanical imprecision in the two mount points creates error.  In addition
to non-squareness causing non-intersection of the axes, translation error also
matters.  One way to model this would be as a sequential link between each of
the rotation axes.  If this includes rotation, then we can even model
non-orthogonality of the mechanical axes.  From the viewpoint of calibration,
this would amount to a more precise kinematics of the stage.

Non-square cross-section of the post or of the mount points also causes non-90
degree rotation, which would not be absorbed into link moments.

First, I would try testing how much of a problem this is, which can be done
mechanically.  All this kinematics seems like a lot of work, and also
absorbing even more DOF into discarded fixture effects seems like it could
absorb real errors.

One possibly test fixture would be a post with a pin sticking out sideways
along what is supposed to be the axis.  I guess you would need to shim the
base of the post to bring in the height to match the actual distance to the
center of rotation.  Can also test parallelism with the translation axes by
reading off the post, and off a square side arm.  OFC this is only an accurate
test insofar is the testing fixture is accurate.  This fixture could be
metal.  Tests for the relative pose of the two mount points can be done with
the sensor mount removed from the stage.

Probably the best way to tune the sensor mount fixture would be to make the
new test fixture, then make the mount agree with it by tweaking in the mount
points.  This potentially solves the height adustment problem, although
tweaking in all the critical faces without going too far is surely tricky.
Perhaps make a new mount rather than tweaking the old one.  I guess finish one
mount, then use the test fixture to bring in the other wrt. to it.

What is the magnitude of the effect of fixture error?  Angular error in the
mount points converts directly to angular error.  Angular error converts to
translation error according to the moment, which is mainly of a concern for
the post height.  This error is basically the non-intersection of the axes.
The moment is the post height, which is only 40mm or so.

What happens with angular errors at the sensor, eg. non-90 degree?  Does this
only affect the angular measurement? Aside from the actual mechanical effect,
there is some rotation->translation coupling in the pose solution itself, but
this effect should be small, so should be very small for a small angular
error.  At least at this point, we mainly want to test and reduce the
rotation->translation coupling seen for large rotations, whether this is
intrinsic in the tracker, or from stage kinematic error.

Looking at the error vectors, there seems to be something like a scale factor
error in Z, where at both + and - Z, the error vectors point inward.  For the
Y effect on error, this mainly seems to be increased magnitude and Rz
coupling, without any clear Y bias at any given point.


I tested the mutual inductance of my cube coil, and also the biggest premo
coil, using the inductance bridge and the shorting method.  Seems to be well
below 1e-3.  I expected higher, 1% or more, especially for my prototype coil.
I think a more sensitive test, especially for the source coil, is to drive in
a current, and then measure the short circuit current on the other axes.  I
could not see any null deflection with my coil, and there was only a just
noticeable deflection with the premo coils.

Summary:
 -- Removing input capacitors on ILEMT box greatly improved accuracy.
 -- Worry about stage and fixturing accuracy.  Could be significant.
 -- Fixed the forward kinematics so that the quadrupole actually is a
    quadrupole.  Showing some benefit now, but the fit is not physically
    plausible.  More data needed.
 -- Idea for coupling bias calibration (eg. for within-box out->in cross coupling).

Woot!  Error is greatly improved, and at 400 um RMS position error, we are
arguably within 2x of our 200 um goal.  (No longer recall whether we said RMS
or max.)  This is with only one fixturing, and will surely be worse with the
three rotations.  We may be nearing the level where ground truth inaccuracy
becomes an issue.

The calibration is somewhat prettier.  The sensor orthogonality is improved
about 2x.  Also, the sensor moment is 0.4x what it was.  This is somewhat
puzzling.  This must have been a gain boost from sensor resonance (which would
have also increased the sensor coil coupling).

Interesting that the source orthogonality is *not* way better compared to the
UR44 setup, even though that did not have off-axis compensation.  But there is
presumably actual non-orthogonality, or at least misalignment which can be
modelled as dipole, so minimizing off-axis terms is only something that is
"pretty". 


This is the "quadrupole" calibration:

This is a pretty unexciting improvement, translation RMS is actually slightly
worse, but rotation is improved a bit.  Cal residual reduced from 3.06e-3 down
to 2.84e-3.


Stage performace, from:
    http://filter.micron.ri.cmu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:asap:calibration:stage
________________________________________________________________

On-axis XYZ repeatability seems to be down around 1 um. Off-axis motion will
of course have both translation and rotation components, but it is difficult
to disentangle because any measurement setup has some moment about whatever
center of rotation there is. On the Z axis, X motion seemed to be within +/-5
um. Angular misalignment of the Z axis has been trimmed down to 100
microradians, at which point runout clearly dominates. Realistically it seems
that for runout + axis misalignment you can expect better than 1 milliradian
(1 micron per mm.) The XY orthogonality seems to be 600 microradians, which is
out of spec, and large enough that it could be affecting Micron
calibration. This would be easier to trim in software.
________________________________________________________________


Stage performance hasn't been directly checked since I wrote this in 2013, so
YMMV.  When compared to the current accuracy (400 um/3.5 mrad RMS), this seems
pretty good.  But need to consider pole moment effects and the RxRy fixture
error (Rz misalignment, etc.).  So far as the pole moment goes, the main issue
would be translation error due to translation->rotation coupling in the XYZ,
and Rz angular runout (Rz to Rx or Ry).

As quick check, If we say the moment is 300mm, then 1 mrad error would create
a 300um offset.  This is significant, so we need to get a better handle on
what we are actually seeing.

FWIW, we are currently getting sensor fixture XY offsets of 40 um.  Does this
reflect on the Rz alignment and RxRy fixture accuracy?  It nominally measures
how well the sensor Z moment is centered on the Rz axis (since the Z dipole
position is forced to 0).  It is not in principle a problem if this were
larger, but the small value is suggestive of actual accuracy.


 ==> I found a bug in the quadrupole forward kinematics which made it into a
     dipole; the two component dipoles did not have opposite signs.

Fixing this did not do much at all until I included dipole in the optimization
also.  With this change, we have so far made somewhat more progress on the
residue, but seem to have pretty much hit the wall at 2.7e-3 after 20
iterations.

Even so, the source X quadrupole moment is changing considerably.  Really need
to let it cook without watching too much, since intermediate states often
don't much resemble the final.
 ==> Conceivably the X quadrupole is bigger because we get closest to that
     coil.

Also, the quadrupole moments are kind of on-axis, but sign flipped.  Being
on-axis is what you would expect if this was absorbing the imperfect dipole
approximation of the ideal dipole-approximating coil geometry.  Or a
rotationally symmetric deviation due to the construction details.  The sensor
parameters (dipole only) don't seem to be changing much, so probably could
speed this up by dropping them out, IDK.  The fixture is not really changing
either, so it seems we are mainly trading the dipole and quadrupole terms
(which is what you would expect).  The dipole positions have moved by mm, and
the source fixture XY by 100's of um.

 ==> The X dipole and quadrupole positions have pretty much converged.

At the very least, I should be using the "medium size" data for calibration.
We may not have enough of the right poses to identify the quadrupole terms.
The way that the quadrupole keeps moving, without any significant effect on
the residual, suggests that we have excess DOF (at least given the data that
we have).  Nothing is "running away" that would give a clear indication, the
dipole components just keep creeping.


 ==> OK, the quadrupole optimization stopped after 88 iterations due to
     FunctionTolerance (failure to reduce the residual), residual 2.741e-3

orientation.  Worst case error is not really helped, but this may be in part
because the calibration data does not cover the full test workspace (for Rz).
In the position error vectors, the pattern that we are worse at -Y is
maintained.  The Z pattern has become fairly symmetrical + and -, but error is
degraded significantly at the edges of the workspace.

The picture of the calibration is pretty similar to the non-final patterns
noted above.  The sensor parameters indeed hardly changed at all.  I can't
make much sense of how widely the quadrupole moments vary across the source
axes.  I am suspicious that we don't have the right calibration data.  The X
quadrupole seems physically plausible because it is largely on-axis and
located very near the dipole.  Well, all of XYZ moments are tend toward the
axis, and are opposite in sign to the dipole.  But the magnitudes are all over
the place, and the locations also seem somewhat random.


I was thinking that we could compensate the within-box out->in coupling by
calibrating an additive offset to the coupling matrix.  But this would
probably need to be a complex coupling because the internal coupling is likely
to be out of phase.  Also, this won't help the interference on the current
sense, eg. for off-axis compensation.  So it seems worthwhile to try magnetic
shielding around the input cards.
 ==> This is linear in the coupling, basically just the mean of the
     calibration residues.

Specificially, convert the predicted coupling back to complex, difference with
the measurement, and then take the mean.  This could be done separately, or
inside the calibrate objective, as an adjustment to the residues (forcing them
to zero mean).



[28-29 Apr 21]

Summary:
 -- Try working in the +X+Y+Z sector of the corner-dipole source.  This may
    reduce coil interaction effects.  Could explain why -Y and -Z are worse.
 -- The lowest norm of couplings in the large Rz data is 0.07 (-23 dB FS).
    Internal out->in cross-coupling seems better than -100 dB, which seems
    like it ought to be too small to matter.  There are very few measured
    couplings (any 3x3 position) which are <1e-3 re. FS. (-60 dB).  (See
    below)
 -- Turning off the source off-axis compensation *does* make things much
    worse [with corner-dipole source], so it is doing some good.
 -- But even with the compensation on, we are quite definitely worse than with
    the UR44 data...  Suspect increased capacitive load of ILEMT input filters.

re. working in the +X+Y+Z sector only.  I had thought of changing to the
symmetric diagonal source orientation back when we had identified the -Y
problem with Claudia, but then thought that this would create a problem with
our optimization constraint (currently +X).  True that we wouldn't get a
hemisphere anymore, only a 1/8 sphere.  But this is really fairly OK for our
application, and certainly fine as a temporary measure.

For source coil interfaction effects, it makes sense that operating at
negative coordinates would be worse, since in those poses there is an off-axis
coil between the source and the sensor.  Even with the off-axis current
nulled, there can still be interference due to eddy currents (that are not
along the wire, so are not measured).  *source* coil interaction can't explain
the Rz->XYZ coupling (especially in the Rz fixturing, where we rotate about
the coil axis), but sensor coil interaction might.


Coupling magnitude range:

The lowest norm of couplings in the large Rz data is 0.07 (-23 dB FS).  I had
previous measured the box internal cross coupling at -100 to -110 dB, or
1e-5.  This is about -77 dB wrt the min coupling magnitude, which would seem
to be a pretty good margin, except that this is more like the strongest
coupling in the matrix, rather than the weakest coupling that matters.  Given
that, more investigation would be needed to decide whether internal coupling
is a problem.  Our accuracy goal is around -60 dB (200 um @ 200 mm), so we
would want an error significantly less than -83 dB (-60 + -23).  -17 dB would
count as "significantly less", but given the very rough guess of what errors
matter, this is not conclusive.

There are very few measured couplings (any 3x3 position) which are <1e-3
re. FS.


Results with no off-axis compensation:

Not super confident in reproducibility because of that mysterious problem on
my cal_4_21 data, but in cal_4_28_nocomp the calibration residual is much
worse (4.9 vs 0.03?), and the tested accuracy is also worse.

So accuracy is better with off-axis cal than not using ILEMT box, but the old
UR44 setup is much better than either.

UR44:
Position error (m): 1.04e-03 RMS, 5.70e-03 max.
Orientation error (radians): 1.23e-02 RMS, 5.15e-02 max

ILEMT w/ off-axis:
Position error (m): 2.35e-03 RMS, 1.19e-02 max.
Orientation error (radians): 2.28e-02 RMS, 1.13e-01 max

ILEMT w/o off-axis:
Position error (m): 3.68e-03 RMS, 1.88e-02 max.
Orientation error (radians): 3.46e-02 RMS, 1.82e-01 max


I am strongly suspecting that the ILEMT box problem is increased load on the
sensor, especially the C load.  Would be interesting to measure on the UR44.

See ilemt_hw/docs/notebook.txt [29 Apr 21]


[27 Apr 21]

I collected the small three-fixture cal data again, and now that is basically
working also.  I must have goofed somehow with the cal_4_21 data.

But... The pose accuracy is *not* better than what we were getting with the
UR44, perhaps worse.  So far I have only tested with the "small" calibration,
either Rz only, or RzRyRz (dipole only)( And evaluated with various data,
either one of the "small" files, or an Rz big file.

The story is roughly similar with different test data.  With the three-fixture
calibration (vs Rz only), the error seems smoothed out more across the
workspace, not so concentrated along the -Y -Z edge.  Also (at least using the
Rz only big test data) it is clear that coupling from Rz to position is the
big contributor to position error.  That is, there is relatively little
tendency toward a general translation nonlinearity.  That is, the translation
errors at different Rz but the same XYZ are splayed out in all directions
(according to Rz), and not trending in a particular direction (independent of
Rz).

Y and Z error (from Rz cross coupling) are considerably larger than X.  Y
coordinate induced effect creates Y dispersion by Rz, and likewise Z creates Z
dispersion.

I tried quantifying the error pattern as a function of the desired pose, using
covariance, but it is not showing such a strong effect, I think perhaps
because the errors are splaying out somewhat evenly in all directions,
potentially cancelling out, and also the pattern of error magnitude increasing
away from the workspace center is a U-shape relation of error to position, so
is nonlinear.


What could be causing the calibration problem?

[A] Source side problems:
  (1) Coil nonideality, either as-built, or the dipole approximation
  (2) Coil interaction

[B] Sensor side problems:
  (1) Coil interaction
  (2) Coil nonideality, either as-built, or the dipole approximation

[C] Input issues:
  (1) Input load causing sensor coil interaction
  (2) Output -> input coupling inside the box
  (3) Input nonlinearity of measurement

[D] Environment:
  (1) magnetic interference (other than from coils)  The steel box itself?

[E] Ground truth problem:
  (1) error in stage kinematics: our command is wrong, or our expected result
      pose is wrong 
  (2) hardware problem in stage (much less likely)
  (3) motion_server problem

[F] Code problem:
  (1) Error in dipole forward kinematics (doesn't seem too likely)
  (2) Error in pose utilities
  (3) Labview signal processing or logging problem.  Is data stable during
      point data averaging?  Synch problem, increase settling time

[G] Physical/design:
  (1) Does error increase in configurations which are somehow unfavorable for
      the pose solution?  eg. something like singularity or observability.
  (2) Are outlier or difficult measurements throwing off the calibration
      process?
       ==> How are calibration residuals affected by pose?

[H] testing methods:
  (1) Is fixture pose optimization having a non-obvious effect?
       ==> Try using the original calibration fixture pose.


Thoughts:

[A](1), [B](2):
It doesn't make sense that coil nonideality would cause error to increase with
increasing source->sensor distance, since the dipole approximation improves
with distance.  Coil nonideality would almost certainly be larger for the
source, because the coils are larger.
 ==> Does error increase with distance?  How can we characterize the error
     variation? Magnitude of coupling or max coupling?
(The X effect on Rz coupling to Y,Z does seem to increase at lower X, eg. closer)

[C](2): coupling strength (distance) vs. error is also a test for inside-box
coupling, which would be most significant when the actual coupling is quite
small.

[G](1): More generally, look for any pattern in the couplings associated with
error.

[A](2) source cross coupling:
Not too keen on this because this seems to have been greatly reduced, and yet
did not help.
 ==> Take calibration and test data w/o source coupling compensation

(FWIW, the sensor moment non-orthogonality is now about the same as for the
source, a degree or so.  For the sensor, the moments trend away from the
adjacent coils, which is what you would expect for a conductive interferer.)

[B], [C]:
The dominant contribution to error from Rz suggests a sensor referred problem.
But we aren't rotating the source, so who knows what would happen then.
 ==> Take test data with source moved/rotated.  Unlikely to help, except
     perhaps for [D](1), but good to know, and we can do it now using
     check_poses().
 ==> Measure rotational response of coupling. eg. Z sensor coupling should not
     change with Rz.  If it does, then this really looks like a sensor error
     (like coil interaction).  But with off-axis moments, some variation is
     expected.  Can also do this test on X, Y coils in the other fixturings
     (but the sensor seems very symmetric).

[C](2):
Definitely investigate sensor coil interaction, which is one of the
few things I can think of that could explain the ILEMT box being worse (if it
is worse).
 ==> What is the effect of an extra sensor coil moved near the sensor?  Open,
     shorted, C load.
 ==> Any effect on coupling if we disconnect the other sensor axes from the
     input?
 ==> How does C load impedance compare to sensor output impedance?

[D](1):
 ==> Try moving the source, the box, the whole setup across the room, ... 
 ==> Check out low-rate calibration.  Is this better, worse, or the about the
     same? 
 ==> Sniff for interference using the old board test fixture.
 ==> Would be nice to have ilemt_ui feature to visualize small changes in
     field vector orientation.

[E](1): ground truth kinematics error:
 ==> Eyball desired pose
 ==> Some sort of round-trip check on the desired pose kinematics
 ==> We had that problem, with the new Corke toolbox not working, which we never
     investigated.  There could be a problem in our utilities, as well as the
     main code.
 ==> Eyeball/test fk_pose_calculation() and vector2tr()

[E](2) stage hardware:
 ==> Test for any mechanical XY motion as Rz is changed, when off center in XY
     plane.  (Already did this to some degree).
 ==> Don't think motion server actually errors if goal pose is not reached,
     though IIRC if there is a really big error then the labview API will error.

[F](1) dipole forward kinematics:
 ==> Test FK using synthetic data

General investigation:
 ==> Look at error visualizations directly incorporating rotation.  The
     linearity test cross coupling may be useful.  Also scatter plots
 ==> Try changing source/sensor fixture positioning so that we use only the
     +X+Y+Z sector.
 ==> Do we get substantially the same data on repeated identical collection
     runs?  With and without refixturing?
 ==> Matlab code issues should not change between old and new hardware.
 ==> Why does the X input seem inverted?  Might be a software problem.


Specific actions/tests:

High priority tests in lab:
 -- Check sensor coil interaction with extra coil, loaded
 -- Get data without source coupling compensation
 -- Try moving the box, wire, etc, look for effect on ilemt_ui
     ==> Effect of tipping box is nil, small effect when slid back off its
         rear feet, down onto motion rack. 
 -- Set up camera to monitor remote stage operation
 -- Try taking data in only the +X+Y+Z sector.  Rotate source so that the
    diagonal source coil symmetry axis is toward the workspace center.

High priority investigation:
 -- Is accuracy actually worse with new box, compared to Sayan's data?
    Sensor load and box out->in coupling are the most obvious ways that things
    could have gotten worse.  Or if source coupling compensation is actually
    bad.  Current results seem broadly similar to what Claudia got.  The lower
    error Claudia reported is at least partly explained by how we subsetted
    the data, IIRC removing the outer -Y plane.
 -- Look at pose error vs. coupling strength, or more generally, any coupling
    pattern related to error.
 -- Try low rate calibration

Other:
 ==> How are calibration residuals affected by pose?
 ==> Try using the original calibration fixture pose. (in check_poses)
 ==> Measure rotational response of coupling. eg. Z sensor coupling should not
     change with Rz.
[Not exhaustive, see all the ==> above]

Error checks to add:
 -- Propagate ilemt_ui errors (clip) into stage_calibration
 -- Check for excess final position error in motion_server.
 -- Add zero poses at beginning and end of test patterns for drift/bump
    check.

Axis offsets:
-2.72	1.552	-3.8	0	0	1.4

Stage alignment check.

Alignment of fixture vertical with stage Z, proxy for normality between
fixture and Rz axis (which we are assuming is parallel to the Z translation
axis).  (Stage Rz @ 90 degrees)

Rx via 25mm Z move, indicated on back of post top mount:
    3 um

Ry via 30mm Z move, indicated on side of fixture post
    125 um


Rz alignment runout, taken at +90 Rz, -90 Rz and 0
	90:  0
	0:   0.031
	-90: 0.060

So basically it is off 30 um in both X and Y.  This is a measure of how
accurately the Rz axis intersects Rx Ry (with some assumption about the
accuracy of the fixtures).  Any non-intersection creates a
rotation->translation moment of the mismatch magnitude.

These alignments all seem fairly reasonable.  The only one that kind of rises
to the level of adjustment is the Ry alignment (pole sideways tip).  But this
has been very soft in the past, difficult to get it to stay below 100 um.
Now, these alignments could certainly contribute 100's of um error across the
workspace, which is a problem for evaluating the desired performance, but
can't explain the 

The Rz runout is going to cause an error of basically that runout. Simple
angular misalignment of the fixture wrt. the stage translation axes is not a
source of error, since the can be absorbed into the fixture transform.  But
non-normality of Rz with Rz Ry is also an error source.  This creates a
magnified error at the edge of the workspace because the points generated by
Rz rotation lie in a different plane that the fixture XY plane.  I guess this
is magnified by the moment ratio of the motion offset vs. the runout
measurment distance.  So over +/-50 mm we would expect about +/- 200 um
above/below the XY plane.

The same magnification would apply to any Rx Ry non-orthogonality (which so
far I have assumed is negligible).


[22 Apr 21]

I got calibration sort of working with data from the ILEMT box.  There seems
to be a sign flip on the sensor X, which is causing both the source and sensor
X moments to be sign flipped.  I recall that this was true with the UR44 also,
and I was negating the X signal in the UR44 settings.

The result calibration is very "pretty", with the off-axis components in the
source moments greatly reduced, and the source fixture also more nearly
aligned in rotation.  The sensor moment magnitudes are almost exactly the same
(because there are no gain knobs).

This is so far only working with the single Z fixturing.  Also, with Sayan's
cal_3_8 data using the UR44, I notice that using Z only gives a much lower
residual.  I am suspicious that I did not do the stage Rz alignment correctly,
since we restarted calibration work with Sayan.  Need to check that the Rz
motion is nulled when moving the stage in "Pose" mode, I had forgotten about
this distinction, and motion_ui defaults to "Absolute axis".

I did mechanical realignment of the stage.  For the stage vertical and Rz
zero, we were within maybe 500 microns or better on the sweeps of 50-100 mm.
The Rx XY position alignment, which I think is most critical, was off by
around 350 microns.
 ==> Getting the sensor mount zeroed wrt. Rz 0 does not matter at all, because
     we can fold that into the sensor fixture.  Getting the mount vertical is
     modestly important so that the Rz axis is orthogonal to Rx Ry.

What are we depending on for the Rx Ry refixturing to work?  I think it's
basically that the XYZ axes intersect and are orthogonal, where the X and Y
axis location are defined by the center of rotation of the sensor fixture.
Maybe the sensor fixture translation can absorb some of the XY offset of the
Rz axis?  IDK I think there is a problem because of the sequential kinematic
order, but we are simulating Rz being after translation in the kinematic
chain.

My feel is that we are lucky if our accuracy is 100 microns, and 200-300 is
more likely.  The pole is just super easy to bump even 100 microns sideways,
and during a Rz move the pole end tweaks by 10's of microns (though it seems
to settle back).

But at the level of error (mm max) we have gotten so far, I don't think the
ground truth accuracy is limiting.
 ==> With the revived test code with the fixture transform optimization, I can
     try accuracy test with just one fixturing.  This will avoid any
     refixturing error.
