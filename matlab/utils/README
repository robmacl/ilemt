These are various general utilities which are mostly not specific to the
tracker use.

Many of these files have been copied from the Peter Corke spatialmath-matlib
library, if you run into an undefined function with a cryptic name, try
looking in that library or download the full library and add it to the matlab
path.  I've copied the files that we seem to be using to reduce the
dependencies and because updates to the libary have sometimes caused things to
stop working.
