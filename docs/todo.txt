 -- Test/debug raw logging integrated with stage_calibration logging. 


Move toward realtime operation:
 -- Get new windows box working
 -- Integrate kim18 pose solution with ilemt_ui
 -- Try labview on linux

Proposal:
 -- Preliminary EMI and MI tests?
 -- Read suggested proposal, adjust?
 -- Write the thing, gdocs "Tracker proposal notes"

Research/implement new stuff:
 -- EMI susceptibility tests
 -- EMI rejection algorithms
 -- Metal rejection: dual rate, phase shift test
 -- Can we figure out derivative of forward model? Try chatgpt
    ilemt/matlab/calibration/fk_coupling.m
 -- EMT scaling laws.  Check existing and look at more tradeoffs.
 
Resurrect/finish stuff:
 -- Resurrect dual rate KF C++, tune it up.
    https://github.com/Alecajuice/ilemt-dual-rate-ukf
 -- What is the intermittent noise problem?  Seems to be happening on
    the driver side since it shows up the the current sense.  Maybe a
    bad driver or DAC board channel issue.  Conceivably also a FPGA
    bug.

Stuff needed for an open design someone might want use:
 -- Port labview signal processing code to C++
 -- Realtime pose solution (eg. via UKF, kim18, etc.)
 -- Documentation
 -- Revise and duplicate hardware. Software potentially useful w/o
    hardware, but this is a minimal sanity check and opportunity to
    document hardware construction.

Publication:
 -- Metal interference paper
     - Data collection nearly done
     - Write up using overleaf
 -- EMI: about to start collecting some data here.  Really
    should have something to show for ILEMT noise rejection.  More CPU
    should re-enable the noise-adaptive KF based on guard channel
    signal.  
 -- Dual rate paper: some results with dual-rate KF. This is also a
    place where we could put dynamics testing results, response time,
    etc., since we will be describing the KF.
     - Not a fully baked idea, but can also incorporate the idea of
       using phase shift to detect metal interference and then guide
       the KF eg. by adjusting the measurement noise.
 -- System/hardware paper
     - System description
     - Can we make this a more narrowly hardware paper? Would be nice
       not to drag in too much about dual rate

Scaling laws:

 -- What happens when sensor is smaller than source.
 -- How does size scale with distance using constant SNR thermally
    limited source?
 -- Can we get at the 6DOF noise sensitivity analytically?  This
    relates to the question of closed form derivatives.  Constant SNR
    definitely doesn't mean constant resolution, and probably not
    constant relative resolution.
 -- Can we get at calibration error scaling analytically?  Deviations
    from the dipole model are probably the main effect, IDK.  If
    deviations have to do with the ratio of source size to sensor
    distance then if we can use a smaller source as we scale up, then
    the relative accuracy may improve.
